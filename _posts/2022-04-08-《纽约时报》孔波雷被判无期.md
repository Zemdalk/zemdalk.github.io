For decades, Blaise Compaoré, the president of Burkina Faso, preferred to avoid the subject of Thomas Sankara, his predecessor and one-time friend who was brutally killed in 1987 by soldiers who gunned him down outside his office.

数十年来，布基纳法索总统布莱斯·孔波雷(Blaise Compaoré)一直回避提及他的前任及曾经的密友托马斯·桑卡拉(Thomas Sankara)，桑卡拉于1987年被士兵在他的办公室外残忍杀害。

On Wednesday, a military tribunal confirmed longstanding, widespread suspicions that Mr. Compaoré, now in living in exile, was in fact behind the killing.

周三，一家军事法庭证实了长期存在的广泛怀疑，即正在流亡的孔波雷先生事实上谋划了这起谋杀案。

After six months of hearings, a heavily protected courtroom in the capital, Ouagadougou, erupted in applause after judges convicted Mr. Compaoré in absentia and declared a sentence of life imprisonment — the climax of a much anticipated attempt to deliver justice for one of Africa’s most infamous political assassinations.

经过六个月的听证后，在首都瓦加杜古一场倍受保护的法庭上，法官缺席判决孔波雷先生有罪，并判处终身监禁。法庭内爆发了掌声，迎来了一次万众期待的高潮，它为非洲最臭名昭著的一起政治刺杀伸张了正义。

“This is a relief,” said Paul Sankara, the slain president’s younger brother, speaking by phone about the verdict. “It’s been a long wait.”

“如释重负，”在电话中谈到本次审判，这位遇害总统的弟弟保罗·桑卡拉(Paul Sankara)说到，“我们已经等待太久了。”

A firebrand Marxist revolutionary, Thomas Sankara became one of the youngest presidents in modern African history when he rose to power in 1983. Over four years he gained a reputation for principled rule and spirited defiance of the West that earned him adulation across Africa.

激进马克思主义革命者托马斯·桑卡拉于1983年上台执政，成为现代非洲历史上最年轻的总统之一。此后四年间，凭借正道的统治和对西方无畏的蔑视，他在非洲饱受赞誉。

But his rule ended violently in October 1987 when Mr. Sankara and 12 other men were killed during the military coup that brought to power his old friend, Mr. Compaoré. For the next 27 years Mr. Compaoré ruled Burkina Faso with a tight grip until a popular uprising pushed him out in 2014, forcing him to flee to Ivory Coast with the help of French soldiers.

但他的统治在1987年10月轰然倒台，桑卡拉先生和12名手下在一场军事暴动中牺牲，他的旧友孔波雷先生则凭借这场行动上台执政。接下来27年间，孔波雷在布基纳法索实行了强硬统治，直到2014年，一场民众起义迫使其下台，并在法军士兵的帮助下逃亡至科特迪瓦。

Mr. Compaoré, however, is unlikely to spend any time in jail soon. He refused to return to Burkina Faso for the trial, and Ivory Coast declined to extradite him. He has always denied any role in the killing, although his explanation of the circumstances has shifted over the years.

然而，孔波雷先生恐无法在短期内入狱。他拒绝返回布基纳法索受审，科特迪瓦方面也拒绝将其引渡。他坚持否认自己参与这起谋杀，尽管多年来他对情形的解释有所变化。

Mr. Sankara’s widow, Mariam, who has lived mostly in France since her husband was killed, was near the front of the courtroom as the sentence was read out.

桑卡拉先生的遗孀玛丽亚姆(Mariam)在其夫被刺杀后长居于法国。法官宣读审判时，她坐在法庭前部。

“I am satisfied,” she told The Associated Press, adding that she wished “the main suspects” in the case were also present.

“我感到满足，”她告诉法新社，并补充道她希望本案中的“主要嫌疑人”也能在场。

Pierre-Olivier Sur, a French lawyer for Mr. Compaoré, said in an interview that his client refused to appear before a “puppet trial” that had taken place in “chaotic and dramatic” conditions.

孔波雷先生的法籍辩护律师皮埃尔-奥利维尔·苏尔(Pierre-Olivier Sur)在一场采访中表示，他的代理人拒绝出席一场在“混乱且戏剧性的”状况下进行的“傀儡审判”。

The trial started in October, 34 years after the death of Mr. Sankara, at a repurposed convention center near the presidential palace in an upmarket part of Ouagadougou. Despite the challenges of mounting a trial decades later, a panel of civilian and military judges heard evidence from over 100 witnesses against Mr. Compaoré and 13 others accused in the killing.

这场审判于桑卡拉先生死后34年的十月份开始。审判地点设在瓦加杜古高档地区总统府附近的一家改建会议中心。尽管面临着在数十年后进行审判的困难，由文职和军事法官组成的小组仍听取了超过100名目击者指控孔波雷及其它13名涉嫌谋杀的嫌疑人的证词。

The proceedings were suspended in late January after the military seized power in Burkina Faso, the latest in a series of coups to afflict the landlocked West African nation since it gained independence from France in 1960.

诉讼程序在一月下旬因布基纳法索军事政变而暂停，自1960年由法国独立以来，一系列政变持续摧残这个西非内陆国家，这场政变则是这一些列政变中的最新一起。

But the trial resumed a week later, and culminated on Wednesday in the convictions and prison sentences that, in many cases, went beyond those demanded by prosecutors. The tribunal also delivered sentences of life imprisonment against Hyacinthe Kafando, Mr. Compaoré’s former head of security, and Gen. Gilbert Diendéré, a senior army commander at the time of the assassination.

但审判于一周后恢复，并于周三的定罪及监禁判决中宣告结束。这场审判在许多方面都超出了检察官的要求。法庭也判决孔波雷先生的前安全负责人亚森特·卡凡多(Hyacinthe Kafando)及暗杀时的陆军高级指挥官吉尔伯特·迪恩代雷(Gilbert Diendéré)将军终身监禁，

Eight others, mostly former soldiers, received sentences of between three and 20 years. Three people accused of creating a false death certificate for Mr. Sankara were acquitted.

其余八人（主要为退役士兵）分别被判决3至20年不等的刑期。被指伪造桑卡拉先生的死亡证明的三人得到无罪释放。

Like Mr. Compaoré, Mr. Kafando was not present in the courthouse, having gone into hiding years ago. General Diendéré, who has been in prison since 2015 for his part in a failed coup attempt, is the only prominent convict likely to serve time.

与孔波雷先生一样，卡凡多先生数年前也已逃匿，未出席法庭。迪恩代雷将军在2015年即因一场未遂军事政变而入狱，他也是仅有的可能入狱服刑的主要罪犯。

Mr. Sankara is still a revered figure in Burkina Faso, and since the ouster of Mr. Compaoré in 2014, his legacy has been openly celebrated. Visitors flock to a giant bronze statue of Mr. Sankara, yards from the spot where he was killed, and his image adorns cars, motorcycles and T-shirts.

桑卡拉先生仍是在布基纳法索广受尊敬的人物，自2014年孔波雷先生下台以来，他的遗产一致被公开庆祝。游客们涌向位于桑卡拉被害地点几码处的他的铜铸雕像，他的形象装饰在汽车、摩托车和T恤上。

The trial represented an effort to establish the truth about his death, as well as a rare if belated attempt to impose justice for a military coup in a region with a long history of military takeovers.

“This is an historic verdict,” said Serge Martin Bambara, a popular rapper and democracy activist known by his stage name Smockey. “It shows that nobody is untouchable.”

Still, the coup that interrupted the trial in January, ousting Burkina Faso’s democratically elected president, Roch Marc Christian Kaboré, and installing yet another military leader, belied hopes that the Sankara trial would act as a deterrent to future military coups.

And the trial avoided longstanding questions about the potential role of outside powers in the death of Mr. Sankara, including France, the former colonial ruler of Burkina Faso, and neighboring Ivory Coast.

One witness described how French officials visited Burkina Faso’s intelligence service one day after the killing, and removed sensitive surveillance materials. But the trial mostly avoided the subject of any international role, which the Burkina Faso authorities have reserved for a separate investigation.

Now that the trial is over, the Sankara family hopes to hold a proper funeral for the assassinated leader, who was buried in a pauper’s grave dug by prisoners at night within hours of his death.

“This is not a moment for satisfaction,” said Paul Sankara, who lives in the United States. “But at least now we can grieve.”

As for the absent Mr. Compaoré, once considered a son by Mr. Sankara’s parents, he said simply: “He has his own conscience.”
