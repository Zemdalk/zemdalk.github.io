# Part I. THE BIG PROBLEM WITH SMALL POTENTIAL

## Chap 1. The Power of Hidden Connections

- The more you help people find their light, the brighter you both will shine. (4)

- Achieving our highest potential is not about survival of the fittest; it is survival of the best fit. (7)

- I saw this firsthand during my twelve years at Harvard as I watched students crash upon shoals of hyper-competition, then get stranded on the banks of self-doubt and stress. Realizing that they were no longer the only superstar, many panicked. (7)

- Almost every attribute of your potential-from intelligence to creativity to leadership to personality and engagement-is interconnected with others. (9)

- **SMALL POTENTIAL** is the limited success you can achieve alone.<br>
**BIG POTENTIAL** is the success you can achieve only in a Virtuous Cycle(will be discussed maybe) with others. (9)

## Chap 2. Lifting the Invisible Ceiling of Potential

- In fact, if you look at a hill while standing next to someone you consider to be a friend, the hill looks 10 to 20 percent less steep than if you were facing that hill alone. That is a stunning finding. <u>Perception of your objective, physical world is transformed by including others in your pursuit of achievement.</u> (14)

- Indeed, their research found that a team on which each person was merely average in their individual abilities but possessed a collective intelligence would continually exhibit higher success rates than a team of individual geniuses. (19)

- In other words, connecting with high-potential people dramatically increases your likelihood of high-potential outcomes. (22)

- Big Potential is about gaining a competitive advantage not by limiting others' success rates, but by raising them. (29)

- A *Virtuous Cycle* is an upward spiral of potential whereby with each success, you garner more resources, which, in turn, allow you to achieve greater and greater successes. (31)

- You can find powerful ways to create Virtuous Cycles of potential by planting these SEEDS(<u>Surround, Expand, Enhance, Defend, Sustain</u>) in your life... Together, these SEEDS themselves create a Virtuous Cycle, lifting the ceiling on your potential higher and higher.(32)
