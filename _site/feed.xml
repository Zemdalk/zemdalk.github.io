        <title>无题1</title>
        <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;这篇随笔是2021年4月3日写就的，当时发在了QQ空间里，我现在把它作为个人博客第一篇文章，也是作为纪念吧。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;好像下学期第一段忧郁时刻就这么悄然而至。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;先是三天前，在写作业的时候看到了同学的一条个签，突然就搁下了手中的笔。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/无题1/1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;pic1&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;起初觉得这话说的不错，但是想要实现所谓的”教育为了成长”太难，当下需要的还是人才与竞争。这样简单的想法促使我再次拿起笔来，但是心里已经觉得不舒服了。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;两天前的晚上，我又在写作业，本打算写完电磁再写线代，却被电磁卡住了，好久却只做了一点点。无奈间负能量突然就涌上来，彻底包围了我。拿起背包，整理退座一气呵成，回到宿舍后带着沮丧的心情写下了这两段话。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/无题1/2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/无题1/3.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;3&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;然后就是今天早上，刚起床就看到高中同学凌晨发的长文以及配图里他大学同学发的朋友圈。人强大的共情能力不禁又包围了我。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/无题1/4.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/无题1/5.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;5&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;其实几周前看到高中同学回忆高中时，我也有认真思考过这个问题。不，我绝对不想回去，不是因为我对高中怨念太深，只是因为我觉得高中，尤其是高三，就是纯粹无意义的内卷式竞争，把所有学过去的知识翻来覆去地”巩固”“提升”。哪有什么好提升的啊，如果真的有什么学两年得巩固提升一年的话，前十二年我应该有四年在一轮二轮三轮复习刷真题吧。而且，从早六到晚十，一周七天或者六天半在盯着陈年烂谷子，希冀得到新内容新思想实现所谓的创新？荒谬。还不是因为竞争而不得不去培养”做题家”，在这方面某北方大省的教育模式真的是让我感到不舒服，从全国上下大张旗鼓宣传开始我就感到不舒服，现在也是，一直是。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;可是高中也至少还有着奋斗目标，虽然一直都是另外两所大学，但是来到这里一点都不遗憾，或者说，除了强基没过那天有些不甘心之外。可是现在我也觉得有幸强基没过，只是因为强基好像从来就不太适合我。我从来就觉得，如果不考虑其它因素的话，我的分数能且只能配得上果壳。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;可是来到果壳，我也是怀着很多憧憬的啊，也是有很多目标，也是有很多想做的事情啊。但是好像一来到这儿后，就有一个无缝不入的声音在说，你配得上中科院的资源，但前提是你得，卷。你得放弃很多来成就学习。这里不是一般意义上的大学。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;也不是没有羡慕过别的同学丰富多彩的大学生活，他们有已经发展了很久而且成体系的学生组织，我们这边还尚欠发展与积淀。但是其实也无所谓，毕竟我喜欢做的事情很大程度上也只是关于我一个人的事情，在哪都一样。刚才在空间里看到舍友发的一句话，”做自己就好了”。不禁想，第一次读到尼采说的”成为你自己”的时候，是很小的时候，那时只是单纯觉得好有哲理，稍微大一点，就开始觉得它像毫无意义的空鸡汤。可是现在，再去思考这句话，却觉得振聋发聩。我哪有真正成为过我自己？我成为的，不过是家长、学校、朋友、优秀的人和无时无刻不在熏陶我的环境所捏造起来的一个人，一个被周围pua的人。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;我从来没有做过的一件事，就是做自己。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;可是这个做自己不是单纯地实现自己的理想，更重要的一点是，它得真正与我内心相配。我不反对内卷，就好像好多人就是适合通过这种方式来学习，好多人也就是从其中得到了快乐（且不谈这快乐的根源是不是外界的pua），可是我不能。我喜欢的不是看不到意义地高唱奋斗伟光正。说实话，一辈子活在”奋斗”的阴影下，不是太可悲了吗？&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;说实话，高中之所以更喜欢北大，真的就是因为校园环境比较自由。可是我希望的自由，不过是前面那句，”成为你自己”。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;我还是喜爱我的大学，即使有过失望，再回到高考那时我还是会选择这里（除非能普通分去北大hhhh）。但是我也不得不对这里的风气保持谨慎的距离。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;有时候夜间惆怅时，我会在想，意义在哪里？以前是为了考高分读好大学，现在是为了什么？可是再一想，以前和现在，不都是为了”成为你自己”嘛。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;临时写就，思绪有些混乱，而且在写的过程中心情与思考也发生了一点变化。不觉间一个小时过去了，昨天晚上还萦绕在耳畔的”太阳下山明早依旧爬上来”，它现在也早已爬上来了。&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Les Ambassadeurs, the first Restaurant we Visited in Paris</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Within the Hôtel de Crillon, which was built in 1758, Les Ambassadeurs operated as a restaurant since the mid-19th century. It reached its peak of fame as a restaurant and nightclub (a café-concert) in the last three decades of the 19th century.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Always a center of entertainment for the aristocracy, in the 1870s it also became a regular destination of some of the best known figures of art and the demi-monde. Edgar Degas and Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec portrayed visitors at the night club, and Aristide Bruant performed there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;It was decorated in an 18th-century rococo style, redesigned by Sybille de Margérie with furnishings by Sonia Rykiel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following a renovation of the hotel in 1981–85, the restaurant occupied a former private ballroom with windows looking out on the Place de la Concorde, a few hundred meters from the Palais Garnier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Les Ambassadeurs had two Michelin stars. In the last decade of its operation, chef was Dominique Bouchet  followed by Jean-François Piège and finally when the hotel closed in 2013 for an extended renovation, Christopher Hache.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2017 Hache opened a smaller restaurant, L’Écrin, within the renovated hotel; the former space of Les Ambassadeurs became a bar.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Much more than a desert: A trip into the Sahara</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The Sahara is a desert located on the African continent. It is the largest hot desert in the world, and the third largest desert overall after Antarctica and the Arctic. Its area of 9,200,000 square kilometres (3,600,000 sq mi) is comparable to the area of China or the United States.[3] The name ‘Sahara’ is derived from a dialectal Arabic word for “desert”, ṣaḥra (صحرا /ˈsˤaħra/).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The desert comprises much of North Africa, excluding the fertile region on the Mediterranean Sea coast, the Atlas Mountains of the Maghreb, and the Nile Valley in Egypt and Sudan. It stretches from the Red Sea in the east and the Mediterranean in the north to the Atlantic Ocean in the west, where the landscape gradually changes from desert to coastal plains.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To the south, it is bounded by the Sahel, a belt of &lt;strong&gt;semi-arid tropical savanna&lt;/strong&gt; around the Niger River valley and the Sudan Region of Sub-Saharan Africa. The Sahara can be divided into several regions including: the western Sahara, the central Ahaggar Mountains, the Tibesti Mountains, the Aïr Mountains, the Ténéré desert, and the Libyan Desert.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For several hundred thousand years, the Sahara has alternated between desert and savanna grassland in a 20,000 year cycle caused by the precession of the Earth’s axis as it rotates around the Sun, which changes the location of the North African Monsoon. The area is next expected to become green in about 15,000 years (17,000 AD).&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>One day we just started our adventure</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The die cut has also been employed in the non-juvenile sphere as well, a recent example being Jonathan Safran Foer’s ambitious Tree of Codes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for this particular rendition of Charles Perrault’s classic tale, the text and design is by Lydia Very (1823-1901), sister of Transcendentalist poet Jones Very. The gruesome ending of the original - which sees Little Red Riding Hood being gobbled up as well as her grandmother - is avoided here, the gore giving way to the less bloody aims of the morality tale, and the lesson that one should not disobey one’s mother.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;It would seem the claim could also extend to die cut books in general, as we can’t find anything sooner, but do let us know in the comments if you have further light to shed on this! Such books are, of course, still popular in children’s publishing today, though the die cutting is not now limited to mere outlines, as evidenced in a beautiful 2014 version of the same Little Red Riding Hood story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first mass-produced book to deviate from a rectilinear format, at least in the United States, is thought to be this 1863 edition of Red Riding Hood, cut into the shape of the protagonist herself with the troublesome wolf curled at her feet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Produced by the Boston-based publisher Louis Prang, this is the first in their “Doll Series”, a set of five “die-cut” books, known also as shape books — the other titles being Robinson Crusoe, Goody Two-Shoes (also written by Red Riding Hood author Lydia Very), Cinderella, and King Winter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An 1868 Prang catalogue would later claim that such “books in the shape of a regular paper Doll… originated with us”.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>London is that kind of place you must visit in this lifetime</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The Queen’s Guard and Queen’s Life Guard (called King’s Guard and King’s Life Guard when the reigning monarch is male) are the names given to contingents of infantry and cavalry soldiers charged with guarding the official royal residences in the United Kingdom. The British Army has regiments of both Horse Guards and Foot Guards predating the English Restoration (1660), and since the reign of King Charles II these regiments have been responsible for guarding the Sovereign’s palaces. The Guards are fully operational soldiers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Queen’s Guard and Queen’s Life Guard are mounted at the royal residences that come under the operating area of the British Army’s London District, which is responsible for the administration of the Household Division. This covers Buckingham Palace, St James’s Palace and the Tower of London, as well as Windsor Castle. The Queen’s Guard is also mounted at the sovereign’s other official residence, the Palace of Holyroodhouse, but not as often as in London. In Edinburgh, the guard is the responsibility of the resident infantry battalion at Redford Barracks. It is not mounted at the Queen’s private residences at Sandringham or Balmoral.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The Queen’s Guard is the name given to the contingent of infantry responsible for guarding Buckingham Palace and St James’s Palace (including Clarence House) in London. The guard is made up of a company of soldiers from a single regiment, which is split in two, providing a detachment for Buckingham Palace and a detachment for St James’s Palace. Because the Sovereign’s official residence is still St James’s, the guard commander (called the captain of the guard) is based there, as are the regiment’s colours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the Sovereign is in residence, the Queen’s Guard numbers three officers and forty other ranks, with four sentries each posted at Buckingham Palace (on the forecourt) and St James’s Palace (two in Friary Court, two at the entrance to Clarence House).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This reduces to three officers and 31 ORs, with two sentries each, when the Sovereign is not in residence. The Queen’s Guard is not purely ceremonial in nature. They provide sentries during the day and night, and during the later hours, they patrol the grounds of the Palace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Until 1959, the sentries at Buckingham Palace were stationed outside the fence. This stopped following an incident involving a female tourist and a Coldstream Guardsman – due to the continued pestering by tourists and sightseers, the guardsman kicked the tourist on the ankle as he marched. The tourist made a complaint to the police and the sentry was confined to barracks for ten days. Not long after, the sentries were moved inside the fence.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Memoirs supports external images as featured</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Adding images is a very annoying task, I know that, but “Memoirs” theme has external featured images integrated so your publishing task becomes easier now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Education must also train one for quick, resolute and effective thinking. To think incisively and to think for one’s self is very difficult.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We are prone to let our mental life become invaded by legions of half truths, prejudices, and propaganda. At this point, I often wonder whether or not education is fulfilling its purpose. A great majority of the so-called educated people do not think logically and scientifically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even the press, the classroom, the platform, and the pulpit in many instances do not give us objective and unbiased truths. To save man from the morass of propaganda, in my opinion, is one of the chief aims of education. Education must enable one to sift and weigh evidence, to discern the true from the false, the real from the unreal, and the facts from the fiction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The function of education, therefore, is to teach one to think intensively and to think critically. But education which stops with efficiency may prove the greatest menace to society. The most dangerous criminal may be the man gifted with reason, but with no morals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The late Eugene Talmadge, in my opinion, possessed one of the better minds of Georgia, or even America. Moreover, he wore the Phi Beta Kappa key. By all measuring rods, Mr. Talmadge could think critically and intensively; yet he contends that I am an inferior being. Are those the types of men we call educated?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We must remember that intelligence is not enough. Intelligence plus character–that is the goal of true education. The complete education gives one not only power of concentration, but worthy objectives upon which to concentrate. The broad education will, therefore, transmit to one not only the accumulated knowledge of the race but also the accumulated experience of social living.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Spoliers Inside - a film review needs hidden spoilers like this post</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Director Roland Suso Richter’s enigmatic psychological thriller (direct to video/DVD) was based upon screenwriter Michael Cooney’s own play “Point of Death” - a title that gave away the film’s entire plot twist premise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As in many similar films, such as Jacob’s Ladder (1990), Soul Survivors (2001), and The Butterfly Effect (2004), events and people were thoroughly distorted and confused because the protagonist was at the point of death. The tagline was misleading:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“When You Don’t Have a Memory, How Can You Remember Who to Trust?”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The mind-warping film opened with a hospital patient Simon Cable (Ryan Phillippe) awakening in a &lt;span class=&quot;spoiler&quot;&gt; hospital with little knowledge (amnesia perhaps?) of what had happened, and why he was there, etc. He was told by attending Dr. Jeremy Newman (Stephen Rea) that it was July 29, 2002 (Simon thought it was the year 2000 - he was confused - he heard a doctor say 20:00 hours!) and that he had died for two minutes from cardiac arrest following the near-fatal accident – but he had been revived (“You’re as good as new”).&lt;/span&gt; Dr. Newman: “Simon, this is the 29th of July. The year is 2002. And your wife, whose name is Anna, is waiting outside.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;what-critiques-say&quot;&gt;What critiques say?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“There’s almost no single moment in Portrait of a Lady on Fire that couldn’t be captured, mounted, and hung on a wall as high art.” &lt;cite&gt;— Entertainment Weekly&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A major clue to everything that truly happened was the scene that played next under the credits - hospital staff failed to bring a patient back to life with a defibrillator after a car accident. Chest compressions failed and there was no pulse. A second major clue was provided by hospital orderly Travis (Stephen Graham): Everybody dies. No mystery there. But why and how everyone dies. Now, there’s a mystery worth solving. Probably the biggest mystery there is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;so-how-do-we-add-spoilers-in-this-theme&quot;&gt;So how do we add spoilers in this theme?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-html&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;span class=&quot;spoiler&quot;&amp;gt;My hidden paragraph here.&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;French wine is produced all throughout France, in quantities between 50 and 60 million hectolitres per year, or 7–8 billion bottles. France is one of the largest wine producers in the world, along with Italian, Spanish, and American wine-producing regions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;French wine traces its history to the 6th century BC, with many of France’s regions dating their wine-making history to Roman times. The wines produced range from expensive wines sold internationally to modest wines usually only seen within France such as the Margnat wines were during the post war period.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two concepts central to the better French wines are the notion of terroir, which links the style of the wines to the locations where the grapes are grown and the wine is made and the Appellation d’origine contrôlée (AOC) system, replaced by the Appellation d’Origin Protégée (AOP) system in 2012.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Appellation rules closely define which grape varieties and winemaking practices are approved for classification in each of France’s several hundred geographically defined appellations, which can cover regions, villages or vineyards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;France is the source of many grape varieties (such as &lt;strong&gt;Cabernet Sauvignon, Chardonnay, Pinot noir, Sauvignon blanc, Syrah&lt;/strong&gt;) that are now planted throughout the world, as well as wine-making practices and styles of wine that have been adopted in other producing countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although some producers have benefited in recent years from rising prices and increased demand for some of the prestige wines from Burgundy and Bordeaux, the French wine industry has seen a decline in domestic consumption and internationally, it has had to compete with many new world wines.&lt;/p&gt;
